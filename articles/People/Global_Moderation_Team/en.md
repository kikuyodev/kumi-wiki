# Global Moderation Team

The **Global Moderation Team *(GMT)*** is a dedicated group of users responsible for overseeing large-scale moderation across the entire game to ensure its smooth operation. Members of this team are easily identifiable by the `GMT` tag, displayed in a distinctive yellow color, as well as their similarly colored title.

Additionally, the team plays a crucial role in addressing any issues that may arise in the game and is responsible for handling reports, appeals, and matters related to the game and its community as a whole.

## Responsibilities

The Global Moderation Team is divided into two categories based on assigned responsibilities, each contributing to the overall upkeep of the game:

### All Members

All members of the Global Moderation Team are responsible for the following:

- **Content Moderation**: Ensuring the proper moderation of all game content and addressing any issues that may arise.
- **Communication**: Regularly communicating with other team members, as well as collaborating with other teams and the broader community.

In terms of community interaction, team members act as a go-to resource, answering questions and guiding the community in the right direction. Additionally, all members actively participate in reviews related to the [Content Usage Guidelines](/wiki/Rules/Content_usage_guidelines).

### Leadership

Leading members of the Global Moderation Team focus on leading the team with an emphasis on being a point of connection between team members and the community. While not required to be the primary community contact, they are proficient in community communication when necessary.

### Forum

Team members assigned to this category are responsible for the upkeep of the [community forum](/forums). They actively engage in forum discussions and are responsible for moderation and maintenance.

### In-Game

Team members assigned to this category oversee the upkeep of the game itself, including addressing issues within the game and its chat.

## Promotion

Promotion to the Global Moderation Team is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering a candidate's ability to communicate with the community and stay informed about the game and its community. The process of finding candidates is a largely internal process, and can take a while to find the right candidate.

Continuously asking about your current status as a candidate is not encouraged as it can discourage current members of the team to want to add or nominate you for the position.

Unlike their sister group, the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), there are no strict requirements needed to ascend to the status of a GMT beyond a few considerations made surrounding a potential candidate's understanding of the game, and their behavior in the community. 

The factors that are generally considered are as follows:

- **Activity**: The candidate's activity in the community, and their ability to communicate with the community.
- **Behavior**: How the candidate behaves in the community, and their ability to act as a role model for the community.
- **Knowledge**: The candidate's knowledge of the game, and their ability to understand the game and its community.
