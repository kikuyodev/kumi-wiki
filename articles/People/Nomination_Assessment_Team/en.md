# Nomination Assessment Team

The **Nomination Assessment Team *(NAT)** is a group of people who are responsible for assessing the quality and condition of the [Chart Nominator](/People/Chart_Nominators) user group, including ensuring that Kumi's mapping scene runs smoothly. They are distinguishable by their user group tag labelled `NAT` with an orange color to it; as well as thair similarly colored title.

They have moderation permissions across the entire game, much like their sister group, the [Global Moderation Team](/People/Global_Moderation_Team); however, with the optional ability to nominate charts for ranked, as well as the ability to disqualify them.

## Responsibilities

The Nomination Assessment Team is responsible for the upkeep of the [Chart Nominators](/People/Chart_Nominators), as well as ensuring that various aspects of the game in its mapping scene run smoothly. Much like the [Global Moderation Team](/People/Global_Moderation_Team), it is split into three categories, allowing it to run efficiently and smoothly; focusing on different aspects of the mapping scene.

### Leadership
Members of the Nomination Assessment Team that are assigned to this category of the team are responsible for the leadership of the team, and act as a point of contact for the team, both internally and externally. They are responsible for handling the Nomination Assessment Team's affairs, and uphold the team's values and principles. Their responsibilities are as follows:

- **Leadership**: Leading the Nomination Assessment Team, and acting as a point of contact for the team, both internally and externally.
- **Communication**: Communicating with the other members of the Nomination Assessment Team, as well as other teams, and the community at a whole.
- **Upkeep**: Ensuring that whatever is required for the Nomination Assessment Team to run smoothly is up-to-date and working as intended.

Additionally, they hold the same responsibilities as the other members of the Nomination Assessment Team, although they are not required to be.

### Nomination

Members of the Nomination Assessment Team that are assigned to this category of the team are responsible for the upkeep of the [Chart Nominators](/wiki/People/Chart_Nominators) user group.

Due to the nature of this sub-team, it should be noted that members of this category are required to be up-to-date with the mapping scene, and are required to be able to nominate charts for ranked if necessary. Additionally, this role has high uptime requirements, due to the nature of assessing the Chart Nominators up front.

- **Applications**: Reading through applications for the Chart Nominators user group, and deciding whether or not to accept them; as well as making sure that current Chart Nominators are still fit for the role by periodically reviewing their performance.
- **Disqualifications**: Disqualifying charts that are deemed unfit for ranked, as well as the removal of Chart Nominators that are deemed unfit for the role.

### Structural

Members of the Nomination Assessment Team that are assigned to this category are responsible for the moderation and structure of the game in its mapping scene, but aren't required to be responsible for staying up-to-date with the mapping scene. However, they are not attached to any obligations to nominate charts for ranked; as they aren't at the forefront of the Chart Nominators user group, and are purely responsible for the structure of their team.

Additionally, it has lower uptime requirements than the Nominations category, due to the nature of not always being needed to handle up front matters.

- **Documentation**: Ensuring that any and all documentation related to the mapping scene is up-to-date, and that any changes to the mapping scene are documented.
- **Moderation**: Moderating the mapping scene, majorly by handling reports and appeals, a trait shared with the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team).
- **Upkeep**: Ensuring that whatever is required for the mapping scene to run smoothly is up-to-date and working as intended.

## Promotion

Up and coming members of the Nomination Assessment Team are expected to be members of the [Chart Nominators](/wiki/People/Chart_Nominators) user group, or were previously members of the Nomination Assessment Team. 

For initial candidates, candidates are considered based on their performance as a Chart Nominator, and their ability to commit to communicating with the community and acting similarly to a teacher at large. Their abilities to communicate with the community are tested by their ability to communicate with the community as a Chart Nominator, and their ability to evaluate charts that are nominated for ranking.

Candidates are determined by current members of the Nomination Assessment Team and/or members of the Kumi team, and are then voted on by the present Nomination Assessment Team. If the vote is successful, the candidate is then promoted to the Nomination Assessment Team.

### Changing Categories

Members of the Nomination Assessment Team are able to change categories, if they are deemed fit for the role. The change of category is determined by the current leaders of the Nomination Assessment Team, and is then checked on by the present Nomination Assessment Team. If the vote is successful, the member is then moved to the new category.

## Members

All members of the Nomination Assessment Team can be found on their [group page](/groups/2), however; a listing of all members can be found below, with their respective responsibilities.
