# Content usage guidelines

Kumi, as a rhythm-based game, offers an immersive experience designed for sharing with others. Utilizing the game's built-in editor and charting capabilities, players can craft and distribute their own charts. Nonetheless, adherence to certain guidelines is essential when engaging in chart creation and sharing. It is imperative to uphold the integrity of the original creator's work and give proper credit to the creators of the content utilized in derivative works. These practices ensure a respectful and collaborative environment within the Kumi community.

Additionally, there are certain visual guidelines that must be followed to ensure that the content used in Kumi is appropriate for all ages.

## Gameplay

When creating or submitting charts, any user involved in the creation of that chart should have the necessary permissions to use the content used for the chart itself.

We do **NOT** condone the use of gameplay elements that are not owned by the creator(s) of the chart, or the use of content that is not licensed for use in other subsequent works.

This includes, but is not limited to:
* The use of charts from other rhythm games not owned by the creator of the chart;
* The use of any difficulties from other charts that are not owned by the creator of the chart;
* And any gameplay content used in a chart that is stripped from another game.

This is to ensure that the integrity of the original creator's work is preserved, that the original creator is properly credited for their work, and to ensure that the content in Kumi is unique to Kumi itself unless otherwise stated.

## Audio

As all rhythm games are centered around music, it is imperative to ensure that the audio used in Kumi is appropriate for all audiences, and that the original creator of the audio is properly credited for their work. Submissions to the game containing content that falls outside of these guidelines is subject to be removed from the game.

All artists reserve the right to request the removal of their content from the game at any time, and we will honor all requests to remove content from the game in compliance with the original creator's wishes. <!-- TODO: DMCA & copyright policy -->

When utilizing audio from artists, it is important to ensure that the original creator of the audio is properly credited for their work, and that the usage guidelines for their works are followed. As such, we require that all submissions to the game containing audio from other creators follow the following guidelines and steps:
* The original creator of the audio must be properly credited for their work if explicitly stated by the original artist.
* Ensuring that the audio used falls under the usage guidelines of the original artist.
* And ensuring that the audio used is allowed by the original artist to be used in derivative works; especially in the case of remixes and covers.

Any audio that is used within Kumi is understood to have permissions to use said audio file. It is the responsibility of the user to gather the respective permissions to use said audio file(s).

## Visual

All visual content used in the game must must follow the usage guidelines of the original creator of the content. Any visual content licensed for use in other derivative works must be properly attributed to the original creator of the content, and must follow the usage guidelines of the original creator of the content; including the usage of content licensed under Creative Commons licenses.

Additionally all visual content must follow the guidelines set forth in the [Visual content guidelines](/Rules/Visual_content_guidelines).

All visual content should be directly attributed regardless of the license used for the content, whether by linking to the original creator's website/profile(s), by linking to the original creator's social media profile; or by linking to the very source of the content itself. This is to ensure that the original creator is properly attributed for their work, in consideration of the fact that creators tend to handle attribution differently depending on varying factors.

If necessary, there are tools available to find the original creator of the content used in the game; such as [TinEye](https://tineye.com/), [Google Images](https://images.google.com/), and [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com/).
