# Content usage guidelines

Kumi as a rhythm-based game is an experience that is meant to be shared with others; through means of charting; and with the use of the game's built-in editor, it is possible to create and share your own charts with others. However, there are some guidelines that must be followed when creating and sharing charts; such as preserving the integrity of a creator's work, and attributing the proper credit to the original creators of the content used in the derivative works that are created.

Additionally, there are guidelines for the visual content that is used in the game; such as the use of custom skins, and the use of custom backgrounds; and
ensuring that the content used in the game is appropriate for all audiences.

## Gameplay

When creating or submitting charts, any users involved in the creation of the chart should have the necessary permissions to use the content that is used in the chart, including charts that are created for other games. We do not condone the use of gameplay content that is not owned by the creator of the chart, or the use of content that is not licensed for use in other derivative works.

This includes, but is not limited to:
* The use of charts from other rhythm games not owned by the creator of the chart;
* The use of any difficulties from other charts that are not owned by the creator of the chart;
* And any gameplay content used in a chart that is stripped from another game.

This is to ensure that the integrity of the original creator's work is preserved, and that the original creator is properly credited for their work; and to
ensure that content in the game is unique to the game itself unless otherwise stated.

## Audio

As all rhythm games are centered around music, it is important to ensure that the audio used in the game is appropriate for all audiences, and that the
original creator of the audio is properly credited for their work and that the integrity of the original creator's work is preserved through attribution. Submissions to the game containing content that falls outside of these guidelines will subject to possible removal from the game.

All artists reserve the right to request the removal of their content from the game at any time, and we will honor all requests to remove content from the game in compliance with the original creator's wishes. <!-- TODO: DMCA & copyright policy -->

When utilizing audio from artists, it is important to ensure that the original creator of the audio is properly credited for their work, and that the usage guidelines for their works are followed. As such, we require that all submissions to the game containing audio from other creators follow the following guidelines and steps:
* The original creator of the audio must be properly credited for their work if explicitly stated by the original artist;
* Ensuring that the audio used falls under the usage guidelines of the original artist;
* And ensuring that the audio used is allowed by the original artist to be used in derivative works; especially in the case of remixes and covers.

Any audio licensed under Creative Commons licenses usually have usage guidelines that must be followed, and it is important to ensure that the usage guidelines of the license used for the audio is followed.

## Visual

All visual content used in the game must must follow the usage guidelines of the original creator of the content. Any visual content licensed for use in other derivative works must be properly attributed to the original creator of the content, and must follow the usage guidelines of the original creator of the content; including the usage of content licensed under Creative Commons licenses.

Additionally all visual content must follow the guidelines set forth in the [Visual content guidelines](/Rules/Visual_content_guidelines).

All visual content should be directly attributed regardless of the license used for the content, whether by linking to the original creator's website/profile(s), by linking to the original creator's social media profile; or by linking to the very source of the content itself. This is to ensure that the original creator is properly attributed for their work, in consideration of the fact that creators tend to handle attribution differently depending on varying factors.

If necessary, there are tools available to find the original creator of the content used in the game; such as [TinEye](https://tineye.com/), [Google Images](https://images.google.com/), and [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com/).
